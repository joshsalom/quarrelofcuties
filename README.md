# Quarrel of Cuties
Quarrel of Cuties is a simple webpage mini-game implemented with the MERN stack. The MERN stack is a JavaScript full stack development technique which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. 

Game Flow: When a user plays, he/she will be presented two pictures of cute animals. The player will choose the picture which he/she finds the cutest among the two. This cute animal will gain a win while the not-so-cute animal will get a loss. All animals have an ELO rating and this ELO rating will alter based on the amount of wins and losses it accured. A ladder ranking will display the cutest animals in the scene. Multiple ladders will display the cutest animals based on day, week, and month. 

Basically, think of cute animals in League of Legend's old ELO rank system but cute animals can only win by captivating the player's attention like in American Idol.
